# Myers-Briggs Machine Learning Natural Language Processing Predictor

This folder contains all of the notebooks and website information for a Machine Learning NLP predictor. For this project we found a strong dataset that had the a user's mbti type and their last 50 social media posts and comments. We then explored that data, cleaned it, tokenized and lemmatized the data. We then created a tf-idf with the data and then ran machine learning algorithms on the resulting data. We also used Tableau to create visualizations showing which personality type is most dominant in the world. We then took the predictor and the visualizations and downloaded it to a web site hosted on the heroku app. Tools used for this project include Jupyter Notebooks, HTML, CSS, Java, Tableau. NLP Libraries such as NLTK and SpaCy. Also Machine Learning algorithms such as Naive-Bayes classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, LightGBM classifier, and file storage systems such as CSV, Parquet and HDF5.
