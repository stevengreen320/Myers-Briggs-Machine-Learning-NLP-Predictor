# Myers-Briggs Machine Learning Natural Language Processing Predictor

This folder contains all of the notebooks and website information for a Machine Learning NLP predictor. We made sure to use a strong dataset, we then explored that data, cleaned it, broke it down to individual words, those words to the root word and then ran machine learning algorithms on the resulting data. We also used Tableau to create visualizations showing which personality type is most dominant in the world. We then took the predictor and the visualizations and downloaded it to a web site hosted on the heroku app.
